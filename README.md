# Deep Learning Assignment 2: Image Classification on iNaturalist

## Overview
In this assignment, I tackle the image classification challenge on a subset of the iNaturalist dataset using two distinct strategies:
1. **Part A** â€“ Crafting a CNN architecture from the ground up  
2. **Part B** â€“ Leveraging transfer learning by fineâ€‘tuning established ImageNet models

## Repository Layout

### Part A: Homeâ€‘grown Convolutional Network
- **Goal**: Implement and train a CNN from scratch without relying on preâ€‘trained weights.  
- **Highlights**:  
  - Parameterizable layers (activations, regularization, augmentations)  
  - Modular design to easily swap in different filter sizes and depths  
- **Source Code**: [A2_Part_A on GitHub](https://github.com/Vishnu000000/DeepLearning_A2/tree/main/A2_Part_A)

### Part B: Transfer Learning Pipelines
- **Goal**: Boost accuracy by fineâ€‘tuning backbone networks like InceptionV3, ResNet, and Xception.  
- **Highlights**:  
  - Options for partial or full unfreezing of base model layers  
  - Customizable classification head with dropout and weight decay  
- **Source Code**: [A2_Part_B on GitHub](https://github.com/Vishnu000000/DeepLearning_A2/tree/main/A2_Part_B)

- **L2 Penalty**: 0.0, 5e-5, 5e-4
- **Learning Rate**: 1e-4, 1e-3

## Detailed Workflow

### Building the Custom CNN
- **Function**: `build_cnn()`  
- **Capabilities**:  
  - Flexible stack of convolutional blocks with configurable filter counts and kernel sizes  
  - Choice of activation, batch normalization, dropout, and L2 regularization  
  - Final fullyâ€‘connected layers sized per the number of target classes  

### Transfer Learning Procedure
1. **Load** a preâ€‘trained feature extractor without its top classifier.  
2. **Attach** a new dense head (fullyâ€‘connected layers + dropout).  
3. **Freeze** selected layers of the base network to retain learned features.  
4. **Optionally unfreeze** more layers for deeper fineâ€‘tuning once the head has stabilized.

## Training & Validation

- **Compilation**: Optimizer with an adaptive learning rate (default 1e-4)  
- **Fit Loop**: Train with `model.fit()`, specifying validation split  
- **Augmentations**: Realâ€‘time image transforms (random flip, rotation, etc.) when enabled  

### Evaluation Metrics
- Overall accuracy and loss curves  
- Perâ€‘class precision and recall  
- Batch or fullâ€‘set predictions via a `predict()` utility
